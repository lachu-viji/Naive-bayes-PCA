# Naive-bayes-PCA
This project demonstrates the implementation of three different Naive Bayes classifiers — Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, and Multinomial Naive Bayes — on three distinct datasets, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize and analyze dimensionality reduction effects.
